<h1 style="text-align:center;">__Telegram bot for text to speech__</h1>

- This is a project to create a telegram bot for voice-over texts in English and Russian. 

- As input, the bot requests a message, then the text of this message is translated into audio format and sent to the user. 

- The bot is written in the Python programming language using the telebot and gTTs libraries for scoring tests. 

- The bot is still in development, so it has not been uploaded to the server and only works when the file is running main.py

- In the file .gitignore contains the bot token and a folder with the Python virtual environment
